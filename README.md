## License Considerations
This project currently doesn't have an explicit license. As a high school student, I'm still learning about FOSS licensing. I'm aware that some code might be problematic in terms of:

License compliance:

  - Possible license incompatibilities
  - Rendering techniques that might be patented

Attribution:

  - Missing credits for referenced resources
  - Incomplete documentation of influences

How You Can Help
If you notice:

  - Files that resemble known licensed implementations
  - Potential license conflicts

I'm considering using MIT License for this project but need to ensure all content is properly attributed and compatible.

## Future Improvements

  - Implement proper lighting
  - Support animated textures
  - Create simple scene format
  - Improve error handling
  - Add comprehensive license documentation

Thank you for reading
